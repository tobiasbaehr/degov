    Given I proof that the following Drupal modules are installed:
      | webform |

    @fail

    Given I have dismissed the cookie banner if necessary

    And I should not see text matching "Webform: External libraries" via translated text in uppercase
    And I should not see text matching "Webform: Source" via translated text in uppercase
    And I should not see text matching "Webform: Test" via translated text in uppercase
