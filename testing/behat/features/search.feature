    And I should see an ".facet-item__value" element with the content "Bild"
    And I should see an ".facet-item__value" element with the content "Video Upload"

  Scenario: I verify that no links are shown on search preview
    Given I have dismissed the cookie banner if necessary
    Given I proof that the following Drupal modules are installed:
      | degov_node_normal_page      |
