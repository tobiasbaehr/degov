# deGov - Drupal 8 for Government


## Notes

deGov is the first Drupal 8 distribution focussing on the needs of (German) governmental organisations. It uses Acquia Lightning as a basis and extends this it with valueable functions to meet the use cases for different scenarios:

- Websites for governmental organisations from all levels (federal, regional, local) to publish information
- Service-oriented E-Government portals to close the gap between citizens and your administration
- Citizen Engagement portals to discuss and decide online
- Open311 portals for civic issue tracking
- Open data portals to publish and create communities around data
